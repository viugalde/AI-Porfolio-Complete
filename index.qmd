## About Me

**Business Consultant, Architect & Urban Designer**  

*“My passion is designing business strategies beyond building drawings.”*

I began my career designing human-centered architecture and urban spaces. After more than a decade in real estate consulting and entrepreneurship, I moved to Vancouver to pursue an MBA and shift my focus to business strategy.

Now, I help shape ideas, build consulting models, and support small businesses as they grow. I co-founded BusinessBear, a consulting firm in British Columbia focused on empowering local entrepreneurs. My goal is to blend creativity with clarity—to reimagine business as a space for transformation.

This portfolio shares my experience, tools, and real-world projects where AI, consulting, and human insight come together.
