After more than a decade in real estate consulting and entrepreneurship, I moved to Vancouver to pursue an MBA and shift my focus to business strategy.\nNow, I help shape ideas, build consulting models, and support small businesses as they grow. I co-founded BusinessBear, a consulting firm in British Columbia focused on empowering local entrepreneurs. My goal is to blend creativity with clarity‚Äîto reimagine business as a space for transformation.\nThis portfolio shares my experience, tools, and real-world projects where AI, consulting, and human insight come together."
