But my life transitioned; I moved to Vancouver, Canada, to study for an MBA, finishing in Fall 2025.\nFor me, it’s been a huge step so far, not just for my career, but because of who I’m becoming. I’m figuring out how to bring that same creative mindset into the world of business. It’s like blending two lives into one. And maybe this sounds like a huge challenge or roadblock, but for me it is my passion; I see it as a world of new possibilities.\nIn parallel, I co-founded a new startup, a consulting firm based in British Columbia: BusinessBear. The company is focused on providing affordable, personalized services for small businesses and entrepreneurs.\nSo, I no longer just build and design physical spaces. Now I also sculpt and craft new business ideas, implement strategies, and redefine processes.\nThat’s the kind of legacy I want to help build.\n\n\nExplore My Work\n\nProjects\n\nResume\n\nSkills\n\nContact"
